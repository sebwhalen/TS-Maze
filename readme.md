Work-in-progress raycasting-based pseudo-3D rendering and maze generation.  Features TBD.

Next steps:

- Map editor should allow setting map size.
- Map editor should allow saving and loading multiple maps.
- Map editor should allow adding exits to maps.
- Walls should have collision.
- The player should have a minimap that shows known tiles.
- Renderer FOV (radius) should be configurable.
