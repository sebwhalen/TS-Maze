Work-in-progress raycasting-based pseudo-3D rendering and maze generation.  Features TBD.

Next steps:

- Map editor should allow setting map size.
- Map editor should allow saving and loading multiple maps.
- Bug: raycaster hits incorrect wall faces when moving north or west.
- Y intercept renderer should be updated to rely on x intercept data again.
