Next steps:

1. Maps should be stored in browser local storage, so that they can be loaded and accessed.
2. Map editor should not allow removing outer wall.
3. Map editor should allow setting map size.
4. Map editor should allow placing player spawn and exit points.
5. Map editor should start painting tiles on click, not on mouse move.
